            <p>I was in my second year of Communications at Avans Breda and I was able to get a suitable part-time job at City Marketing Breda via Expressare. I can fully apply my knowledge of school in my work, and I feel as if I can develop myself very well and prepare for my career later in the Marketing business! Expressare matched me very well, I couldn't have done it myself!</p>
